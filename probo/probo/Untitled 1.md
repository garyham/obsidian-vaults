In this still-emerging market, few customers understand what they really want from a PV system.

The thoughts tend to go along the lines of…

-   Immediately lower bills
-   With payback in 5-10 years and free energy after that
-   With assured supply during grid disruption
-   Possibly charging using off-peak electricity
-   Doing my bit for the environment
- ⚡ Few really understand their energy needs - peaks and troughs, total daily use, high-demand appliances - nor think about how those needs may change over time.

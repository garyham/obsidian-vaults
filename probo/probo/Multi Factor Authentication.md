A factor in authentication is a way of confirming your identity when you try to sign in. For example, a password is one kind of factor, it's a thing you know. The three most common kinds of factors are: 

-   Something you know - Like a password, or a memorized PIN. 
    
-   Something you have - Like a smartphone, or a secure USB key. 
    
-   Something you are - Like a fingerprint, or facial recognition.

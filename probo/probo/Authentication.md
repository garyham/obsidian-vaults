When you sign in - a processÂ we call "authentication" - you're proving to the service that you are who you say you are. 

Traditionally that's been done with a username and a password. Unfortunately, that's not a very good way to do it. Usernames are often easy to discover; sometimes they're just your email address. 

Since passwords can be hard to remember, people tend to pick simple ones, or use the same password at many different sites.
